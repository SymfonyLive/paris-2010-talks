## Using Doctrine migrations and lime testing

<dl>
  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>
    Maintaining the database structure during the development process of an application can be hard when working
    together with other people. Using Doctrine Migrations and lime Testing you can ensure that everyone working on
    the application has the same database structure. This decreases conflicts during the development process and is
    also very helpfull when delpoying new versions of your applications to your live servers. In this session I'm going
    to show how to set up Doctrine Migrations in symfony projects and how you can use tests to check that everything
    works after you migrated your database.

## The symfony community - How you can (get) help

<dl>
  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>
    Any community is about a good balance of giving and taking and in the symfony
    community there is no difference. During this talk, this balance between giving
    and taking in the symfony community will be discussed. Both for individual developers
    and for companies, this presentation will show you ways of getting help from the community
    as well as contributing to the community. At the end of the presentation, you will be able
    to create a healthy balance between the two.

## An offline admin generator with HTML 5 and Gears

<dl>
  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>
    Symfony does a lot of things, so as your admin-generator. However,
    we still need to be connected to our app to use them. Gears, and now
    HTML 5, makes our web pages offline capable, so why not our
    admin-generators? We'll see how to contribute to your app from a
    submarine or a cave and how to improve online performances with
    local caching. The conference will be the occasion for the release
    of a Gears-Admin generator plugin.

## Internationalization

<dl>
  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>
    Internationalization is an important feature in a worldwide project.
    All-important projects required at some point to be used by people
    with different cultures and languages. This constraint must be
    understood from the application architecture to the implementation.

## Symfony internals

  <dd>
    Have you ever wondered what happens to an HTTP request when it
    reaches a symfony application ? We are going to dive into the core
    of symfony, watch what's happening under the hood and explain when
    and how you can hookup to customize symfony to your needs.

## Doctrine 2: Not the Same Old PHP ORM

<dl>
  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>
    Jonathan will present on the latest version of Doctrine, 2.0. As the
    title suggests, Doctrine 2 is not the same old PHP ORM. It has been
    almost completely re-designed and coded from the ground up. The new
    version addresses performance problems, limitations and design
    problems of Doctrine 1.

## Debugging symfony applications

<dl>
  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>
    In the presentation I would like to review several techniques that we employed to debug
    our main web site. The website is built on top of symfony and delivers more than five
    millions page views per day so we had to rapidly respond to production problems.
    We used several techniques to reach the root of the problems, all of them using or extending
    tools provided by symfony.

## Using symfony events to create clean class interfaces

<dl>
  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>
    Using symfony Events you create code that's pluggable to
    nearly every part of the application. If you're using events your code
    gets decoupled and testable, too. In this session I'm going to show
    you can use symfony's Events to create extendable applications and how
    events can be used to make your code more reusable.

## Symfony in the Cloud

<dl>
  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>
    One user's experience as Lead Developer on Nebul.us upgrading a symfony application for deployment to Amazon's
    cloud-based infrastructure. We will discuss the obstacles met along the way, including juggling master and slave
    database connections and writing uploaded files to S3. Additionally, integration with the symfony configuration
    and environments system will be demonstrated, allowing one application to be developed locally and seamlessly
    deployed to the cloud.

## Symfony and Zend Framework

<dl>
  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>
    Choosing a framework is often a tough decision -- particularly if there
    are non-overlapping features you require. Symfony offers a
    well-integrated core with comprehensive code generation that can get
    your application jump started and well under way within minutes, but
    what happens if you need something outside that core? What if you see
    something in Zend Framework you wish to use?

## Optimizing PHP code

<dl>
  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>
    PHP is a powerfull language, and his Zend Engine has a lot of powerfull feature but
    also some performance problems. You need to avoid some of those problems if you are searching
    performances. The goal will be to show you how PHP works inside and how you could avoid the penalty
    of some part of the Zend Engine. This starting from small and quick hacks up to major changes
    on how to handle problems.

## Okapi meet symfony, symfony meet Okapi

<dl>
  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>
    The Okapi framework was initially developed by the Liip AG together
    for use at local.ch as thin layer mainly handling XSLT transformation
    and request mapping between the Java backend and the PHP based
    frontend. It has evolved since then but has stayed true its heritage
    of being the thinnest possible layer that combines various open source
    libraries. In this spirit the sfYaml component was integrated in
    version 1.1 of the framework. Okapi 2 has integrated various
    additional symfony components to further reduce the amount of code
    that has to be maintained in house, while at the same time giving
    Okapi a very modern architecture having adopted the event dispatcher,
    request handler, service container components. This sessions explains
    why we choose to integrate these components and how we went about
    implementing them and more importantly what lessons we learned along
    the way.

## Introduction to Git

<dl>
  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>
    This talk will cover what Git is and how it differs from Subversion or
    Perforce. We will go over why it’s so powerful and how it turns source
    control from a necessary annoyance into a powerful development tool.
    We will cover the technical underpinnings of the system, common tips
    and best practices for getting the most out of Git and ways to use Git
    that you may not have thought of before – as a pure
    content-addressable filesystem. Attendees will leave with a better
    understanding of Git and hopefully a new way of thinking about how to
    work.
